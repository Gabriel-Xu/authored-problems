Cookie Monster and Elmo are playing yet another cookie-eating game. On his turn, Cookie Monster can eat $n$ cookies while Elmo can eat $m$ cookies. If there are less cookies remaining than the number of cookies the player is allowed to eat, they eat all of the cookies that are left. 

The player who eats the last cookie is given the prestigious title of Cookie Connoisseur. If there are initially $c$ cookies and Cookie Monster starts eating cookies first, who is the Cookie Connoisseur?
