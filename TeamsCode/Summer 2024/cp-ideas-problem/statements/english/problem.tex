\begin{problem}{Digit Removal}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

Given an integer $a$, count the number of different ways to remove exactly $4$ digits of $a$ such that the resulting integer is less than $b$.

\InputFile
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) "--- the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($10^4 \le a < 10^{10000}, 1 \le b < 10^{10000}$). It is guaranteed that the number of digits in $a$ is exactly $4$ more than the number of digits in $b$.

---

There are $10$ tests, not including samples. Each test is worth $\frac{100}{10}=10$ points.

\OutputFile
Output a single integer "--- the number of ways to make $a$ less than $b$ after removing $4$ digits.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
In the first test case of the sample test, the only digits you can remove are $6$, $3$, $4$, and $7$ to make $22196$.

In the second test case of the sample test, you can remove the $5$ and then remove any three digits after the first $0$ for a total of $56$ different ways.
