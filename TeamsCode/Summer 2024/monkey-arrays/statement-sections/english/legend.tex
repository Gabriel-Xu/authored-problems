Yash really likes monkeys and special arrays. Because he was curious, Curios George gave Yash an array $A$ of length $N$, and now Yash wonders how many \textit{good} subarrays exist in this array.

Specifically, Yash deems a subarray \textit{good} if $X$, his favorite number, is the maximum value in the subarray, $Y$, his second favorite number, is the minimum in the subarray, and $K$, his least favorite number, is not in the subarray. In other words, in a given subarray, $X$ should be the maximum value, $Y$ should be the minimum, and $K$ should not be in the subarray.
