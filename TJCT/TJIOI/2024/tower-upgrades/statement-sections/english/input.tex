The first line contains two integers $n$ and $h$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le h \le 10^6$).

The second line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \le c_i \le 10^6$) "--- The cost to upgrade each tower.

The next $n-1$ lines each contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$) "--- indicating an edge connecting nodes $u$ and $v$.

It is guaranteed that the given graph forms a tree.
