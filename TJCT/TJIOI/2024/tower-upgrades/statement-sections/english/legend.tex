There is a tree$^\dagger$ with $n$ nodes. A Cookie Monster with $h$ health will travel through the tree, starting at node $1$. Each node has a tower situated at it, initially with $p_i=0$ power. The Cookie Monster takes $p_i$ damage when visiting $i$ which decreases its health by $p_i$. After taking damage, the Cookie Monster will arbitrarily choose to traverse an edge to an adjacent node which has not been visited yet. 

If after the Cookie Monster takes damage at a node, it has positive health and has no valid moves (all edges at its current node lead to already visited nodes), it wins. You can perform the following operation as many times as you want: increase the $p_i$ by $1$ with a cost of $c_i$. Find the minimum cost needed to guarantee the Cookie Monster cannot win.

$^\dagger$ A tree is an undirected graph in which there is exactly one simple path connecting any two vertices.
