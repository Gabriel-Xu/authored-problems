Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) "--- the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($10^4 \le a < 10^{10000}, 1 \le b < 10^{10000}$). It is guaranteed that the number of digits in $a$ is exactly $4$ more than the number of digits in $b$.

There are $10$ tests, not including samples. Each test is worth $\frac{100}{10}=10$ points.
