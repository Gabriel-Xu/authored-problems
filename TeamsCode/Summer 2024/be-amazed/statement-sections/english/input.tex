Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) "--- the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \cdot m \le 10^6$) "--- the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix $a$.

Each of the next $n$ lines contains a binary string of length $m$ "--- the description of matrix $a$. It is guaranteed that the value of the top left corner is $1$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.

There are $20$ tests, not including samples. Each test is worth $\frac{100}{20}=5$ points.
