In the first example, both $14$ molecules of carbon dioxide and $18$ molecules of water allow for $2$ molecules of glucose and $12$ molecules of oxygen. $2$ molecules of carbon dioxide and $6$ molecules of water are left over since they cannot be used in another reaction.


In the second example, since there are $0$ molecules of water, photosynthesis does not take place and no glucose molecules or oxygen molecules are be produced.
