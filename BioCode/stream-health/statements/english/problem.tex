Dr. Xu is measuring the amount of nitrates ($\text{NO}_3$) and phosphates ($\text{PO}_4$) in a nearby stream. Dr. Xu wants to make sure the stream is healthy for drinking, agriculture, recreation, industry, reducing flood damage, and providing habitat for aquatic animals. There are a variety of methods to measure how clean a stream is, such as evaluating the condition of aquatic wildlife and different chemical tests.


Dr. Xu performs $t$ tests on the stream for the $\text{NO}_3$ level as $a_i$ and $\text{PO}_4$ level as $b_i$. Help him determine the approximate average $\text{NO}_3$ level and $\text{PO}_4$ level of his tests.

\InputFile
The first line contains an integer $t$ $(1\le t\le 1000)$ "--- the number of tests.


The second line contains $t$ space separated integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_t$ $(0\le a_i\le 10^6)$ "--- the amount of nitrates for each test of the stream.

The third line contains $t$ space separated integers $b_1,b_2,...,b_t$ $(0\le b_i\le 10^6)$ "--- the amount of phosphates for each test of the stream.

\OutputFile
Output two space separated integers "--- the average $\text{NO}_3$ level and $\text{PO}_4$ level.


To make the answer contain integer values, truncate the decimals. For example, if the true average were $17.8$, then the answer would be $17$.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
The average of $1$, $2$, and $3$ is $\frac{1+2+3}{3}=2$.


The average of $5$, $1$, and $7$ is $\frac{5+1+7}{3}=4.333...$, which truncates to $4$.
