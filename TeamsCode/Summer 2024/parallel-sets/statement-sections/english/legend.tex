Given the array $[ 1,2, \ldots ,2 \cdot n ]$, partition it into $2$ subsequences $a$ and $b$ of length $n$ such that each element of the original array is present in one of $a$ or $b$. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given array by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

For each index $i$ ($ 1 \le i \le n$), you are given one of the three following constraints: $a_i+b_i = v_i$, $|a_i-b_i| = v_i$, or $\text{max}(a_i, b_i) = v_i$. Find the number of possible subsequences $a$ and $b$, modulo $10^9+7$. It is guaranteed there exists at least one partition that satisfies the constraints.
