\begin{problem}{Cookie Eating II}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{512 megabytes}

Cookie Monster and Elmo are playing yet another cookie-eating game. On his turn, Cookie Monster can eat $n$ cookies while Elmo can eat $m$ cookies. If there are less cookies remaining than the number of cookies the player is allowed to eat, they eat all of the cookies that are left. 

The player who eats the last cookie is given the prestigious title of Cookie Connoisseur. If there are initially $c$ cookies and Cookie Monster starts eating cookies first, who is the Cookie Connoisseur?

\InputFile
The first line contains $3$ integers $n$, $m$, and $c$ ($1 \le n, m, c \le 10^9$).

\OutputFile
Output a single string "--- \texttt{Cookie Monster} if Cookie Monster will win and \texttt{Elmo} if Elmo will win and be named Cookie Connoisseur.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\exmpfile{example.03}{example.03.a}%
\exmpfile{example.04}{example.04.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
In the first test case, Cookie Monster will eat $2$ cookies, Elmo will eat $4$ cookies, and Cookie Monster will eat $2$ cookies again. Since there are less than $4$ cookies left, Elmo will eat all of them and become the Cookie Connoisseur.
