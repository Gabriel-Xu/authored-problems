Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4)$ "--- the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers $N$, $X$, $Y$, and $K$ ($1 \le N \le 5 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le Y < K < X \le 10^9$).

The second line of each test case contains $N$ integers $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N$ ($1 \le A_i \le 10^9$) "--- the elements of the array $A$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$.

Tests in subtasks are numbered from $1-20$ with samples skipped. Each test is worth $\frac{100}{20}=5$ points.

Tests $1-5$ satisfy that the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $100$.

Tests $6-10$ satisfy that the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.

The remaining tests do not satisfy any additional constraints.
