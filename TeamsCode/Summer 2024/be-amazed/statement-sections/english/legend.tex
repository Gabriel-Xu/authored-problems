XORnet has created the most difficult game yet, and Little Jonny wants to be the first to beat it. He is given a matrix $a$, consisting of $n$ rows by $m$ columns. Each element of the matrix is equal to $0$ or $1$, and he needs to reach the bottom right corner starting from the top left corner by only stepping down or right. However, he may only step on $1$s. Little Jonny is also a very accomplished hacker, so he managed to give himself an XORgun, which, when used, can toggle all the values in a row, changing the $1$s to $0$s and $0$s to $1$s (unfortunately, his skills did not extend to enable toggling for columns). All uses of the XORgun must be done before he takes his first step. Find the minimum number of uses of the XORgun that allow Little Jonny to beat the game.
