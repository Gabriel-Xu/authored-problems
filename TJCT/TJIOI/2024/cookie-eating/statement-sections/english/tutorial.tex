Together, Cookies Monster and Elmo remove $n+m$ cookies in their turns. They will keep doing this until the number of cookies and left is less than $n+m$. If the number of cookies left is $0$, that means Elmo took the last cookie and there are none left. Otherwise, if the number of cookies left is less than or equal to $n$, Cookie Monster can remove all the remaining cookies. If this is not the case, Elmo wins.
