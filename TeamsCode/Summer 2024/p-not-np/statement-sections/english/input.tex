The input consists of a single integer $P$ ($1 \le P \le 10^5$) "--- the upper bound on $p$.

Tests in subtasks are numbered from $1 - 10$ with samples skipped. Each test is worth $\frac{100}{10}=10$ points.


Tests $1 - 5$ will satisfy $P \le 1000$.

The remaining tests do not satisfy any additional constraints.
